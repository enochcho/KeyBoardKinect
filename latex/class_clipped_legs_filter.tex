\label{class_clipped_legs_filter}\index{Clipped\+Legs\+Filter@{Clipped\+Legs\+Filter}}


Filter\+Clipped\+Legs smooths out leg joint positions when the skeleton is clipped by the bottom of the camera F\+OV. Inferred joint positions from the skeletal tracker can occasionally be noisy or erroneous, based on limited depth image pixels from the parts of the legs in view. This filter applies a lot of smoothing using a double exponential filter, letting through just enough leg movement to show a kick or high step. Based on the amount of leg that is clipped/inferred, the smoothed data is feathered into the skeleton output data.
